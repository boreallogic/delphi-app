## Key Observations

1. **Best-Evidenced Domains**: Shelter & Housing and Transportation have the strongest evidence base with multiple overlapping sources.

2. **Evidence Gaps**: Workforce indicators (WF01-WF05) have limited evidence due to confidential data requirements.

3. **Unique RRN Evidence**: Several indicators are justified specifically by RRN literature:
   - Pet-friendly shelter capacity (Wuerch, 2020; 2021)
   - Confidentiality policies (Farhall, 2020; CREVAWC, 2021)
   - Alternative justice measures (Ross, 2019)
   - Extractive industry policies (Vector Research et al., 2022; Paukuutit, 2021)

4. **Cross-Cutting Themes**:
   - Geographic isolation appears as risk factor for 15+ indicators
   - Financial barriers appear across multiple domains
   - Cultural safety is relevant to healthcare, justice, and support services

5. **Measurement Justice Considerations**:
   - Several indicators address power dynamics (community surveillance, dual relationships)
   - Indigenous-specific protective factors identified (alternative justice, language access, cultural safety)
   - Data quality limitations acknowledged transparently
