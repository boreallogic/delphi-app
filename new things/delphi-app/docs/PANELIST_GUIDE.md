# GBV Indicators Framework
## Panelist Guide & Rationale

## What We're Asking You To Do

We've developed a framework of indicators to measure GBV service capacity across Yukon communities. Your role is to help us:

1. **Prioritize** which indicators matter most
2. **Validate** whether our measurement approaches make sense
3. **Assess** how feasible data collection will be

Your expertise—whether from research, service delivery, policy work, or lived experience—is essential for creating a framework that actually works in northern, rural, and remote contexts.

## How The Framework Is Organized

### Two Tiers of Indicators

We've organized the 50 indicators into two tiers to make your task manageable:

| Tier | Count | Your Task | Why This Matters |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Tier 1: Core Framework** | 27 | Full assessment (priority, validity, feasibility) | These indicators have strong data sources and are ready to implement |
| **Tier 2: Extended Framework** | 23 | Optional comments only | Important but face data challenges; preserved for future development |

**You'll only rate Tier 1 indicators.** Tier 2 indicators are shown for context, and you can comment on them if you wish, but they won't be part of the consensus process.

### Eight Domains

We've consolidated the indicators into 8 domains with plain-language names:

| Code | Domain Name | Guiding Question | Tier 1 Count |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| A | **Safe Places to Stay** | Can survivors access emergency and transitional housing? | 5 |
| B | **Getting Where You Need to Go** | Can survivors travel to services safely? | 4 |
| C | **Health Care That Understands** | Do healthcare providers recognize and respond to GBV? | 3 |
| D | **Protection and Justice** | Can survivors access legal protection and support? | 4 |
| E | **Help When You Need It** | Are crisis and counselling services available? | 6 |
| F | **Money and Independence** | Can survivors access money and resources to leave? | 2 |
| G | **How Systems Work Together** | Do organizations have policies that protect survivors? | 2 |
| H | **Community Conditions** | How does the broader context affect survivor safety? | 0 (Tier 2 only) |

## What Makes an Indicator "Tier 1"?

An indicator was placed in Tier 1 if it met these criteria:

1. **HIGH or critical MEDIUM priority** — directly affects survivor safety and access
2. **Reliable data source exists** — we can actually collect this information
3. **Actionable** — results can inform policy or service changes

### Examples of Tier 1 Indicators

> **SH01: Number of emergency shelters in community**  
> Plain language: "How many emergency shelters can survivors go to in this community?"  
> Why Tier 1: Fundamental capacity measure, data readily available from shelter organizations

> **TR03: Distance to nearest hospital with SANE**  
> Plain language: "How far is the nearest hospital where survivors can get a forensic exam after sexual assault?"  
> Why Tier 1: Critical for forensic evidence collection, affects justice outcomes, calculable via GIS

> **PL07: Workplace GBV policies in extractive industry**  
> Plain language: "Do mining companies have policies about GBV and harassment?"  
> Why Tier 1: Direct relevance to Yukon context, data available through YESAB registry

### Examples of Tier 2 Indicators

> **HC02: Number of healthcare workers with IPV training**  
> Why Tier 2: Important concept, but training records are confidential and data reliability is LOW

> **WF01: Staff turnover in GBV sector**  
> Why Tier 2: Would require confidential workforce survey; data doesn't currently exist

> **SQ06: Community readiness for new GBV programs**  
> Why Tier 2: Requires primary research (key informant interviews) for each community

## What We're NOT Asking

- **We're not asking you to design the indicators** — that work is done
- **We're not asking you to collect data** — this study is about validating the framework
- **We're not asking you to rate all 50 indicators** — focus on the 27 Tier 1 indicators

---

## The Rating Scales

For each Tier 1 indicator, you'll provide three ratings:

### 1. Priority (1-5)
*How important is this indicator for measuring GBV service capacity in Yukon?*

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not important — could be dropped |
| 2 | Slightly important — nice to have |
| 3 | Moderately important — useful but not essential |
| 4 | Very important — should definitely include |
| 5 | Essential — framework would be incomplete without it |

### 2. Validity (1-5)
*Does the operationalization actually measure what we're trying to measure?*

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not valid — measures the wrong thing |
| 2 | Somewhat valid — captures part of the concept |
| 3 | Moderately valid — reasonable approximation |
| 4 | Very valid — captures the concept well |
| 5 | Highly valid — excellent measurement approach |

### 3. Feasibility (1-5)
*How realistic is data collection for this indicator in Yukon communities?*

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not feasible — data doesn't exist and can't be created |
| 2 | Difficult — major barriers to collection |
| 3 | Moderately feasible — some challenges but doable |
| 4 | Feasible — straightforward to collect |
| 5 | Easily feasible — data already exists and is accessible |

## Qualitative Input

Beyond ratings, we want your reasoning:

- **Why did you rate it this way?** Your reasoning helps us understand disagreements and improve the framework
- **Threshold suggestions:** What value would indicate "adequate" vs. "inadequate"? (e.g., "Less than 2 hours travel time to SANE should be the standard")
- **Dissent flag:** If you understand where the group is heading but want your disagreement preserved in the final report, check this box

### Why Dissent Matters

Traditional Delphi methods aim for consensus. But in measurement justice work, minority perspectives—especially from lived experience—shouldn't be smoothed away. If you flag dissent, your view will be recorded in the final report even if it differs from the group.

## How Rounds Work

### Round 1
Rate each Tier 1 indicator based on your own judgment. Don't worry about what others think.

### Rounds 2-3
You'll see:
- Your previous ratings
- The group's median and spread (IQR)
- Anonymized themes from other panelists' reasoning

You can revise your ratings if you're persuaded, or keep them and flag dissent if you're not.

### Consensus
We'll consider consensus reached when the interquartile range (IQR) is ≤ 1.0 on the 5-point scale. This means 50% of panelists are within 1 point of each other.

## Tips for Assessment

1. **Consider the northern context** — What works in urban centres may not work here
2. **Think about data burden** — More indicators isn't better if they can't be sustained
3. **Imagine using the results** — Would this indicator help a community advocate for resources?
4. **Draw on your expertise** — Your specific knowledge is why you were invited
5. **Be honest about uncertainty** — "I don't know" is valuable information

---

## Time Commitment

- **Per round:** 45-60 minutes for 27 indicators
- **Total:** 3 rounds over approximately 4-6 weeks
- **Format:** Complete at your own pace before each deadline
