# Indicator Reframing Analysis: From Supply-Side to Pathways-to-Safety

## Guiding Principles

The white paper establishes that **infrastructure is determinant, not indicator**. This means:
- We're not measuring whether services exist; we're measuring whether **survivors have viable paths to safety**
- Each indicator should answer: "Does this condition enable or block a survivor's pathway?"
- The framing should be survivor-centered, not system-centered

### Key Reframing Questions
1. Does this measure what a survivor can DO, not just what EXISTS?
2. Does it capture RRN-specific barriers (distance, confidentiality, isolation)?
3. Is it framed as a pathway (can they get there?) rather than a resource (does it exist)?

## Domain A: Safe Places to Stay

### SH01 - Emergency Shelter Access
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Count of facilities providing emergency overnight accommodation for GBV survivors |
| **Current Plain** | How many emergency shelters can survivors go to in this community? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors in crisis have any emergency shelter option they can realistically reach |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can a survivor in this community get to emergency shelter when they need it? |
| **Rationale** | Shifts from counting facilities to assessing actual accessibility. A community with 3 shelters 500km away has zero pathway; a community with 1 shelter 10km away has a pathway. The count is less important than the existence of a viable option. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary with context: Yes/No + distance + access constraints (fly-in, seasonal road, etc.) |

### SH02 - Transitional Housing Access
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Count of transitional housing units specifically for GBV survivors post-shelter |
| **Current Plain** | How many transitional housing units are available for survivors after they leave the shelter? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors leaving emergency shelter have housing options that don't require returning to abuser |
| **Proposed Plain** | After leaving shelter, can survivors find housing without going back to the abuser? |
| **Rationale** | The pathway question isn't "how many units" but "is there a next step?" Zero units = pathway ends at shelter. Even 1 unit = pathway continues. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary + waitlist reality: Yes/No + typical wait time + capacity constraints |

### SH03 - Shelter Access Time
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Average number of days from crisis contact to shelter placement |
| **Current Plain** | How long do survivors typically wait to get into a shelter? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can access shelter quickly enough to escape immediate danger |
| **Proposed Plain** | When a survivor reaches out in crisis, can they get to safety the same day? |
| **Rationale** | "Average days" obscures the critical question: can they escape NOW? A 2-day average is meaningless if someone in danger tonight can't get in tonight. Frame around immediate safety. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Same-day access typical / 1-3 days / Longer waits common / Often at capacity |

### SH04 - Pet Accommodation
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether shelter accommodates companion animals and number of animal spaces |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors bring their pets to the shelter? |
| **Proposed** | Whether having pets blocks survivors from accessing shelter |
| **Proposed Plain** | If a survivor has pets, can they still escape to shelter? |
| **Rationale** | Reframes from "shelter feature" to "survivor barrier." In RRN contexts, pets/animals are common; this is a make-or-break pathway issue, not an amenity. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary: Yes, pets accommodated / No, pets are a barrier to access |

### SH05 - Distance to Shelter
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Kilometres from community's main intersection/centre to nearest GBV shelter |
| **Current Plain** | How far do survivors have to travel to reach the nearest shelter? |
| **Proposed** | Whether distance creates an insurmountable barrier to reaching shelter |
| **Proposed Plain** | Is shelter close enough that survivors can actually get there in a crisis? |
| **Rationale** | Raw km is meaningless without context. 50km with a car is accessible; 50km with no car, no bus, and $800 flights is impossible. Frame as "is the pathway open or closed by distance?" |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Accessible (<50km + transport exists) / Difficult (50-200km or transport barriers) / Practically inaccessible (>200km or fly-in only) |

### SH06 - Pet-Friendly Rental Housing (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Proportion of rental housing stock that permits pets |
| **Current Plain** | What percentage of rental housing allows pets? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors with pets face housing barriers when rebuilding independent lives |
| **Proposed Plain** | After leaving shelter, can survivors with pets find housing? |
| **Rationale** | Connects to long-term pathway: shelter → transitional → independent housing. If pet-friendly rentals are rare, the pathway narrows or closes for survivors with animals. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Adequate options exist / Limited options / Severe barrier |

## Domain B: Getting Where You Need to Go

### TR01 - Public Transit Existence
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether any scheduled public transit service operates in community |
| **Current Plain** | Is there any public transit in this community? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors without personal vehicles have any way to reach services |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get to services if they don't have their own car? |
| **Rationale** | The pathway question isn't "does transit exist" but "can a survivor without a car get to safety?" This might include transit, taxi, ride programs, etc. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Multiple options / Limited options / No options without personal vehicle |

### TR02 - Emergency Transportation
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Availability of crisis transportation (not requiring personal vehicle) |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors get emergency transportation without needing their own car? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can get to safety in a crisis without depending on their abuser for transport |
| **Proposed Plain** | In an emergency, can survivors get somewhere safe without relying on their abuser for a ride? |
| **Rationale** | Makes explicit the coercive control dimension: abusers often control transportation. The pathway must not depend on the person causing harm. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary + mechanism: Yes (specify: taxi vouchers, VS transport, shelter pickup) / No |

### TR03 - Distance to SANE Services
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Kilometres to nearest Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program |
| **Current Plain** | How far is the nearest hospital with a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE)? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors of sexual assault can access forensic medical care within the evidence collection window |
| **Proposed Plain** | After a sexual assault, can survivors get to a SANE nurse in time to collect evidence (within 72-120 hours)? |
| **Rationale** | Time-critical pathway. The question isn't distance but "can they get there in time?" Frame around the biological reality of evidence collection windows. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Accessible within window / Accessible but challenging / Effectively inaccessible within window |

### TR04 - Travel Funds
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether dedicated travel subsidy exists for GBV service access |
| **Current Plain** | Is there money available to help survivors pay for travel to get services? |
| **Proposed** | Whether cost of travel blocks survivors from reaching services |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors afford to travel to services, or is there help to cover travel costs? |
| **Rationale** | In RRN contexts, travel costs can be $hundreds-$thousands. The pathway question is whether cost is a barrier that can be overcome. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Funds available and adequate / Funds exist but insufficient / No travel support |

### TR05 - Transportation Options Count (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Count of distinct crisis transportation mechanisms available |
| **Current Plain** | How many different ways can survivors get emergency transportation? |
| **Proposed** | Whether multiple transportation pathways exist (redundancy if one fails) |
| **Proposed Plain** | If one transportation option doesn't work out, are there backup options? |
| **Rationale** | Redundancy matters for reliability. A single option that's unavailable (taxi driver is abuser's friend, VS worker is away) closes the pathway entirely. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Multiple independent options / Single option / No options |

---

## Domain C: Health Care That Understands

### HC01 - SANE Access Type
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Type of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner access available |
| **Current Plain** | What kind of access do survivors have to SANEs? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors of sexual assault can access specialized forensic care without prohibitive barriers |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can sexual assault survivors actually get to a SANE, or are there too many barriers? |
| **Rationale** | Combines with TR03 to assess the full pathway. Having a SANE 500km away with no transport = no pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Accessible (local or reachable) / Theoretically available but major barriers / No realistic access |

### HC02 - IPV-Trained Healthcare Workers (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Count of healthcare providers with documented IPV/DV training |
| **Current Plain** | How many healthcare workers have training on intimate partner violence? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can expect healthcare providers to recognize and respond appropriately to GBV |
| **Proposed Plain** | If a survivor goes to a doctor or nurse, will they know how to help with GBV? |
| **Rationale** | Shifts from counting trained individuals to assessing likelihood of appropriate response. One trained nurse among 10 untrained = low likelihood of pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Most providers trained / Some training exists / Training rare or absent |

### HC03 - Primary Care Access
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether community has resident or regular visiting primary care |
| **Current Plain** | Does the community have regular access to a doctor or nurse practitioner? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors have a consistent healthcare provider who could recognize signs of abuse |
| **Proposed Plain** | Is there a regular doctor or nurse who might notice if someone is being hurt? |
| **Rationale** | Healthcare as potential disclosure point. Visiting providers who change frequently = no relationship = no pathway for recognition. Resident providers = relationship-based pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Consistent resident provider / Regular visiting (same person) / Rotating visitors / No access |

### HC04 - Trauma-Informed Mental Health
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether mental health services with trauma specialization exist |
| **Current Plain** | Are there mental health services available that specialize in trauma? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can access mental health support that won't retraumatize them |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get counselling from someone who actually understands trauma? |
| **Rationale** | Badly-delivered mental health services can harm. The pathway isn't just "services exist" but "services are safe to use." |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Trauma-specialized services accessible / General MH available (not trauma-specific) / No MH access |

### HC05/WF05 - Indigenous Cultural Safety Training (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether healthcare workers have completed Indigenous cultural safety training |
| **Current Plain** | Have healthcare workers completed Indigenous cultural safety training? |
| **Proposed** | Whether Indigenous survivors can expect culturally safe care that won't recreate colonial harms |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can Indigenous survivors trust that healthcare workers will treat them with respect and understanding? |
| **Rationale** | For Indigenous survivors, cultural unsafety closes pathways. Training is proxy for whether the pathway is safe to use. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Cultural safety is standard practice / Some training exists / Training rare or absent |

---

## Domain D: Protection and Justice

### LJ01 - Victim Services Access
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether Yukon Victim Services has presence/outreach in community |
| **Current Plain** | How can survivors access Victim Services in this community? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can connect with victim services support when they need it |
| **Proposed Plain** | When survivors need help navigating the system, can they actually reach Victim Services? |
| **Rationale** | Presence types (office, visits, phone) matter less than "can they connect when needed?" Frame around survivor need, not service delivery model. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Readily accessible / Available with effort / Difficult to access |

### LJ02 - Legal Aid Availability
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Number of legal aid hours available for family/protection matters |
| **Current Plain** | How many hours of legal aid are available for family and protection matters? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can get legal help for protection orders and family matters without paying out of pocket |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors who can't afford a lawyer still get legal help for protection orders? |
| **Rationale** | Hours allocated is abstract. Pathway question: "Can they get legal help?" Means-testing and eligibility matter as much as hours. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Legal aid accessible and adequate / Available but limited / Effectively unavailable |

### LJ03 - Specialized DV Court
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether Domestic Violence Treatment Option Court serves community |
| **Current Plain** | Is there a specialized domestic violence court (DVTO) that serves this community? |
| **Proposed** | Whether the justice system has specialized capacity to handle DV cases appropriately |
| **Proposed Plain** | Does the court system have specialized knowledge about domestic violence? |
| **Rationale** | General courts often mishandle DV. Specialized courts = better outcomes pathway. Frame around whether the justice pathway is safe to use. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary: Specialized DV court available / General court only |

### LJ04 - Alternative Justice Options
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Availability of restorative/Indigenous justice options for GBV |
| **Current Plain** | Are there restorative or Indigenous justice options available for GBV cases? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors have justice options beyond the colonial court system |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors choose how to seek justice, including Indigenous or restorative approaches? |
| **Rationale** | For many Indigenous survivors, colonial courts are not a safe pathway. Alternative justice = alternative pathway that may be more accessible/appropriate. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Multiple justice pathways available / Limited alternatives / Colonial court only |

## Domain E: Help When You Need It

### SS01 - GBV-Specific Services Count
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Count of organizations with explicit GBV service mandate |
| **Current Plain** | How many organizations in this community specifically help GBV survivors? |
| **Proposed** | Whether dedicated GBV support exists in the community |
| **Proposed Plain** | Is there anyone in this community whose job is specifically to help GBV survivors? |
| **Rationale** | Zero = no pathway. One or more = pathway exists. The count matters less than existence. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Multiple GBV-specific services / One GBV-specific service / General services only / Nothing |

### SS02 - Virtual Service Access
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether GBV services can be accessed remotely |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors access GBV services by phone or video? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can get help without physically going somewhere (critical for isolation/surveillance) |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get help by phone or video if they can't leave home or don't want to be seen going somewhere? |
| **Rationale** | Makes explicit why virtual matters: surveillance by abuser, inability to leave, stigma of being seen. Virtual = private pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Binary: Virtual options available / In-person only |

### SS03 - Counselling Wait Time
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Average days from referral to first counselling appointment |
| **Current Plain** | How long do survivors wait to see a counsellor? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can access counselling support when they're ready, without prohibitive waits |
| **Proposed Plain** | When survivors are ready to talk to someone, can they get an appointment soon? |
| **Rationale** | Readiness to seek help is fragile. Long waits = window closes. Frame around "when they're ready" not system processing time. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Prompt access (<2 weeks) / Moderate wait (2-6 weeks) / Long wait (>6 weeks) |

### SS04 - 24/7 Crisis Line
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether 24/7 crisis support is accessible from community |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors call a crisis line any time day or night? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can reach help during nights/weekends when danger often peaks |
| **Proposed Plain** | If something happens at 2am on a Saturday, can survivors reach anyone for help? |
| **Rationale** | Crisis doesn't follow business hours. Frame around when danger peaks (nights, weekends, holidays). |
| **Data Implication** | Binary + access: 24/7 accessible / Limited hours |

### SQ02 - Information in Accessible Formats
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether GBV service information distributed via formats accessible without internet |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors learn about services without needing internet access? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can find out help exists even without internet access |
| **Proposed Plain** | If a survivor doesn't have reliable internet, can they still find out what help is available? |
| **Rationale** | Can't access a pathway you don't know exists. In RRN, internet is unreliable. Non-digital information = pathway visibility. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Multiple non-digital formats / Some non-digital / Internet-dependent only |

### SQ03 - Indigenous Language Services
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether GBV services available in local First Nation languages |
| **Current Plain** | Can survivors access services in their First Nation language? |
| **Proposed** | Whether Indigenous survivors can get help in their own language |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can Indigenous survivors get help without having to use English? |
| **Rationale** | Language barriers close pathways. For Elders and others with limited English, English-only = no pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Indigenous language services available / Interpretation available / English only |

### SQ04 - Service Integration (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Degree to which services are co-located or require multiple separate contacts |
| **Current Plain** | How many different places do survivors have to go to get help? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors face navigation burden that exhausts them before they get help |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get help without having to tell their story over and over to different agencies? |
| **Rationale** | Fragmented services = re-traumatization + exhaustion. Each handoff is a dropout point. Integrated = smoother pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Integrated/coordinated / Somewhat connected / Fully fragmented |

---

## Domain F: Money and Independence

### EC01 - Emergency Financial Aid
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether emergency funds specifically for GBV situations exist |
| **Current Plain** | Is there emergency money available specifically for GBV survivors? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can cover immediate costs of leaving without the abuser's money |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get emergency money for things like food, phone, or a safe place to stay? |
| **Rationale** | Economic coercion is real. Leaving requires money. Frame around breaking financial dependence on abuser. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Emergency funds accessible / Funds exist but hard to access / No emergency funds |

### EC02 - Relocation Funds
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether financial support for relocation away from abuser exists |
| **Current Plain** | Is there money to help survivors move away from their abuser? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can afford to permanently leave and establish independent housing |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get help paying for damage deposits, moving costs, and first month's rent? |
| **Rationale** | Long-term pathway from shelter to independence. Without relocation support, shelter becomes revolving door. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Adequate relocation support / Some support but gaps / No relocation support |

### CC02 - RRN Cost Burdens (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Additional costs faced by survivors in RRN contexts |
| **Current Plain** | How much extra does it cost survivors to live in a rural, remote or northern area? |
| **Proposed** | Whether RRN-specific costs (fuel, animals, travel) create additional barriers to leaving |
| **Proposed Plain** | Do the extra costs of living in a rural area make it even harder for survivors to leave? |
| **Rationale** | Contextualizes economic barriers. $5000 emergency fund in urban area goes further than in fly-in community with $8 milk. |
| **Data Implication** | Estimated additional annual cost + qualitative assessment of barrier severity |

### CC03 - Childcare Availability (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Access to licensed childcare as economic independence enabler |
| **Current Plain** | How available is childcare for parents trying to become independent? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors with children can access childcare needed to work and rebuild independence |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors with kids find childcare so they can work and support themselves? |
| **Rationale** | Without childcare, employment is impossible → economic dependence continues → can't sustain independence. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Childcare accessible / Limited availability / Severe shortage |

---

## Domain G: How Systems Work Together

### PL01 - RRN Confidentiality Policies
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether GBV service providers have explicit policies for small-community confidentiality challenges |
| **Current Plain** | Do service providers have policies for keeping things confidential in RRN communities? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can seek help without everyone in town finding out |
| **Proposed Plain** | Can survivors get help confidentially, even in a small community where everyone knows everyone? |
| **Rationale** | In RRN, confidentiality breach = social death, retaliation, danger. The pathway is only safe if it's private. Frame around survivor safety, not policy existence. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: RRN-specific confidentiality protocols active / Generic policies / No specific protections |

### PL02 - Dual Relationship Policies (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Protocols for when service provider has pre-existing relationship with victim or perpetrator |
| **Current Plain** | Do service providers have policies for when they already know the survivor or abuser? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors can get help even when the service provider knows them or their abuser |
| **Proposed Plain** | What happens if the only nurse/counsellor in town is your cousin or your abuser's friend? |
| **Rationale** | In RRN, dual relationships are inevitable. Without protocols, pathways close because survivors don't trust providers who know them. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Clear protocols with alternatives / Some awareness / No protocols |

### PL07 - Extractive Industry Policies
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether active mine sites have documented GBV/harassment policies |
| **Current Plain** | Do mining companies have policies about GBV and harassment? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors working in extractive industries have workplace protections and pathways to report |
| **Proposed Plain** | If a miner or camp worker experiences harassment or violence, does the workplace have ways to address it? |
| **Rationale** | Work camps are high-risk environments. Without policies, survivors in these settings have no workplace pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Comprehensive policies + reporting mechanisms / Basic policies / No policies |

### PL04 - Interagency Collaboration (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Existence and activity level of formal coordination mechanisms |
| **Current Plain** | How well do different agencies work together on GBV? |
| **Proposed** | Whether agencies coordinate to create seamless pathways rather than forcing survivors to navigate alone |
| **Proposed Plain** | Do services work together, or do survivors have to figure out everything themselves? |
| **Rationale** | Uncoordinated services = gaps survivors fall through. Coordination = continuous pathway. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Active coordination / Informal connections / Siloed services |

### PL05 - Referral Pathways (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Whether documented referral protocols exist between key services |
| **Current Plain** | Are there clear documented pathways for referring survivors between services? |
| **Proposed** | Whether survivors get smoothly connected to next steps or dropped between services |
| **Proposed Plain** | When one service can't help, do they make sure the survivor gets connected to someone who can? |
| **Rationale** | Each referral is a dropout risk. Documented pathways = warmer handoffs = survivors stay in system. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Clear warm referral pathways / Ad hoc referrals / No referral system |

### WF01-WF04 - Workforce Indicators (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Various workforce metrics (turnover, burnout, training, debriefing) |
| **Current Plain** | Various questions about GBV workforce stability and support |
| **Proposed** | Whether the GBV workforce is stable enough to maintain consistent pathways for survivors |
| **Proposed Plain** | Are there enough supported workers to keep services running reliably? |
| **Rationale** | High turnover = service disruption = pathways close unpredictably. Combine into single "workforce stability" indicator. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Stable supported workforce / Some instability / Critical workforce gaps |

---

## Domain H: Community Conditions

### CC04 - Geographic/Social Isolation (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Composite measure of community isolation |
| **Current Plain** | How geographically and socially isolated is this community? |
| **Proposed** | Whether isolation multiplies barriers across all other pathways |
| **Proposed Plain** | Does this community's isolation make every other barrier harder to overcome? |
| **Rationale** | Isolation is a risk multiplier. Frame as modifier that affects all other indicators. |
| **Data Implication** | Index score with interpretation: Low isolation / Moderate / High / Extreme |

### CC01 - Housing Market Pressure (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Impact of market trends on rental availability |
| **Current Plain** | How much pressure is there on the housing market? |
| **Proposed** | Whether housing scarcity makes the pathway from shelter to independence impossible |
| **Proposed Plain** | Is housing so scarce that survivors have nowhere to go after shelter? |
| **Rationale** | Market conditions determine whether the housing pathway exists at all. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Housing available / Tight market / Crisis-level scarcity |

### SQ05 - EPO Effectiveness (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Rate at which EPOs are granted and enforced |
| **Current Plain** | Do Emergency Protection Orders actually get granted and enforced? |
| **Proposed** | Whether legal protection actually protects or is paper-only |
| **Proposed Plain** | If a survivor gets a protection order, will it actually keep them safe? |
| **Rationale** | EPOs that aren't enforced = false pathway. Measure whether the legal pathway actually works. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Reliably granted and enforced / Inconsistent / Rarely effective |

### SQ06 - Community Readiness (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Assessment of implementation feasibility for new interventions |
| **Current Plain** | Is the community ready to support new GBV programs? |
| **Proposed** | Whether the community context supports or undermines survivor pathways |
| **Proposed Plain** | Does the community support survivors, or does stigma keep people silent? |
| **Rationale** | Community attitudes determine whether formal pathways are safe to use. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Supportive environment / Mixed / Hostile to disclosure |

### PE01-PE02 - Prevention Programs (Tier 2)
| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Current** | Presence of prevention/education programs |
| **Current Plain** | Are there programs to educate people about GBV prevention? |
| **Proposed** | Whether community-level prevention efforts exist to reduce future violence |
| **Proposed Plain** | Are there programs trying to prevent GBV before it happens? |
| **Rationale** | Prevention is about future pathways. Less violence = fewer people needing pathways. Keep as secondary/contextual. |
| **Data Implication** | Categorical: Active prevention programs / Occasional efforts / None |

## Summary of Key Changes

### Framing Shifts
1. **From counting to access**: "Number of X" → "Can survivors access X?"
2. **From existence to usability**: "Does X exist?" → "Can survivors actually use X?"
3. **From system metrics to survivor experience**: "Service hours" → "Can survivors get help when ready?"
4. **From abstract to concrete**: "Distance in km" → "Can they get there in crisis?"

### RRN-Specific Additions
- Confidentiality as pathway safety
- Dual relationships as barrier
- Distance as access, not just geography
- Cost as barrier in context of RRN prices
- Redundancy as reliability in isolated contexts

### Data Collection Implications
Many indicators shift from continuous/count measures to categorical assessments:
- Easier for communities to assess
- Directly answers "is the pathway open?"
- Reduces false precision (exact km matters less than "accessible vs not")

## Next Steps

1. **Review with Sara and Lisa**: Do these reframings capture what you're trying to measure?
2. **Identify cuts**: Some indicators might be redundant under new framing
3. **Revise data collection tools**: Align measurement approach with pathway framing
4. **Update CSV definitions**: Apply approved reframings to Definition_Plain column
5. **Consider consolidation**: Some indicators might combine (e.g., workforce indicators)
